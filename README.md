## Exploratory and Geospatial Analysis of Artisanal Mining Sites in the DRC

The latest 2023 Cobalt Market Report noted that 73% of cobalt demand is being driven by battery applications. As the world slowly embraces a transition to clean energy, 96% of the 2023 demand growth was due to electric vehicle (EV) production, followed by portable electronics and energy storage, as cobalt remains a necessary component of lithium-ion batteries. As demand increases due to cobalt's potential increase to battery life and energy intensity, the supply chain is seeing increased pressure and urgent efforts to address the persistent human rights violations are more important than ever. Additionally, research and development and investment is needed to reduce cobalt in lithium-ion batteries and cobalt-free battery alternatives that are economically viable and safe. Such alternatives have already started to be explored including organic cathode materials developed by MIT chemists and lithium-iron phosphate batteries already in use in some of Tesla's newer vehicles. 

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) mines 2/3's of the global cobalt supply and has the world's largest reserve. Below I will explore open data from artisinal mining sites in the Eastern DRC made available by the International Peace Information Service (IPIS). IPIS is an independent research institute with a mission to realize a vision of durable peace, sustainable development and the fulfilment of human rights.

The focus of the exploratory and geospatial analysis is on highlighting the hazardous working conditions and environmental disruption to the surrounding protected natural areas.
